	<h2>Help and FAQ's</h2>
    <h4>Why does the map not load on my computer?</h4>
    <p>If the map does not load and all you can see is a blue background then it is likely that your browser or graphics card does not support WebGL. You should see a popup which will notify you of this fact. Updating your browser to the newest version of <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> will usually solve the problem.
    <h4>How do I rotate the map?</h4>
    <p>To rotate the campus map simply click the left <i class="fa fa-caret-left"></i> or right <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> buttons towards the bottom of the screen. This will rotate the map by a small amount in your chosen direction.</p>
    <h4>How do I change perspective?</h4>
    <p>The button to change perspective is found between the two rotation buttons at the bottom of the screen <i class="fa fa-th-large"></i>. This button will switch between three perspective types: the standard perspective view, a low perspective view and a birds-eye view.</p>
    <h4>How do I switch to satellite mode?</h4>
    <p>Satellite mode can be toggled on or off using the button at the bottom right of the screen. It is recommended that you do not use satellite mode when viewing data overlays as it will make it very hard to read the information being displayed on the map.</p>
    <h4>Can I zoom in the map?</h4>
    <p>Yes the map can be zoomed in by scrolling the mouse wheel or pinching two fingers together on a touch device.</p>
    <h4>How do I display data on the map?</h4>
    <p>All data overlays can be toggled on or off via the sliding navigation to the left of the screen. Select one of the buttons <i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i>, <i class="fa fa-location-arrow"></i> or <i class="fa fa-bar-chart-o"></i> in the left navigation to reveal a list of data (i.e. building types, bus routes, subject data) which can then be toggled to appear on the map.</p>
    <h4>Can I find a building or room easily?</h4>
    <p>Yes, any building or room can be found by using the search bar at the top of the screen. Start typing your query to reveal suggestions, click on one of the suggestions and you will be taking to the corresponding building. If searching for a room you will be taken to the building which includes the particular room. You can then select the room from the rooms list which will take you to the University of Kent website.</p>
    <!--<h4>What does the magnifying glass icon do?</h4>

    <h4>What are the question mark icons for?</h4>
    <p>When you click one of the question mark icons it will reveal an interesting fact about that area of the campus. They usually involve information on how the University is improving its facilities and services.</p>
    <h4>What are the Twitter icons for?</h4>

    <h4>Where can I find the Social Feed?</h4>
    <p>The social feed can be found by clicking the 'Social' link at the top right of the screen from the map view.</p>
    <h4>How do I switch between different social streams in the Social Feed?</h4>
    <p>Clicking the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> icon will reveal options that allow you to filter which results are shown in the Social Feed.</p>
    <h4>How do I sort the Social Feed?</h4>
    <p>Clicking the <i class="fa fa-sort-amount-desc"></i> icon will reveal options that allow you to sort the results by time and arrange them as a grid or list.</p>
