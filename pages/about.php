	<h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>The aim of the project is to create an interactive 3D experience to help users learn about the University of Kent Canterbury campus.</p>
    <p>The idea was to create a scale model of the Canterbury campus where all of the buildings are interactive and display information when clicked. Data can then be toggled to display on the map in various different ways including: colour changes to the building models, coloured bus routes and 3D bar graphs.</p>
    <p>The project is also an experiment in web-based real-time 3D graphics using the popular javascript library Three.js. Several new functions were created solely for this project including: positioning a HTML element on the screen at 3D coordinates and loading a large number of 3D models at once while making them all fully interactive.</p>
